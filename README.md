Rock Paper Scissor Project

This is a Rock paper Scissors project built by me for The Odin Project course. 

The application in its current state works only in with the javascript console in the web browser. It is played by using the prompts that are displayed on executions, which return a result after a score of "5" has been reached.

There is currently no user interface for the application, however, that will be added in the next iteration.
